# Data Structures

The data structures implementations can be founded in the **dataStructures** folder, to interact with each data
structure, run the `Main` class and select the desired option in the console. Here is a list of the
implemented data structures:

```
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque (double ended queue)
- Binary Tree
- Graph
```

Aside from the data structures, you can also interact with some **Sorting Algorithms**, the implementations of these
algorithms are found in the same folder, to used them all you have to do is select the _Sorting Algorithms_ option in
the main menu, here is a list of the implemented sorting algorithms:

```
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort
```

## Tower of Hanoi

This was an assignment of the data structures module separated from the core incremental project, as the name implies,
this class is an implementation that solves the well known Towers of Hanoi problem using Stacks implemented in class.
Run the `TowerOfHanoi` class to select the number of disk you want to use and the program will calculate all the needed
steps to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem

## Bubble Sort

This is another assignment of the module and for that reason is separated from the **dataStructures** folder. Just run
the `BubbleSort` class and the program will require you to enter the numbers you want to sort, after that the class will
applied the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the provided numbers.
